What is AWS?Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform offering infrastructure, storage, networking, and security solutions.

What are the key services provided by AWS?

Compute: EC2, Lambda

Storage: S3, EBS, EFS

Databases: RDS, DynamoDB

Networking: VPC, Route 53

Security: IAM, KMS, Security Groups

What is EC2 in AWS?Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides scalable virtual machines in the cloud.

What is an S3 bucket?S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service for storing files and backups.

Explain the difference between S3 and EBS.

S3: Object storage for files, backups, and static content.

EBS: Block storage used as a disk for EC2 instances.

What is IAM in AWS?IAM (Identity and Access Management) controls access to AWS services and resources securely.

How does AWS VPC work?VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) enables the creation of isolated networks within AWS.

What are Security Groups and how do they work?Security Groups act as firewalls, controlling inbound and outbound traffic to AWS resources.

What is an AWS region?A region is a geographic location where AWS has data centers.

What are Availability Zones in AWS?Availability Zones (AZs) are multiple, isolated locations within a region for redundancy.

What is Auto Scaling?Auto Scaling automatically adjusts EC2 instances based on demand.

What is Elastic Load Balancing?ELB distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances for better performance.

What is Route 53?AWSâ€™s scalable DNS and domain name registration service.

Explain the difference between a public and private subnet.

Public Subnet: Accessible from the internet, uses Internet Gateway.

Private Subnet: No direct internet access, uses NAT Gateway.

What is CloudFormation?Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service for managing AWS resources using templates.

What is AWS Lambda?A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events.

What is Amazon RDS?A managed relational database service supporting MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more.

How do you monitor AWS resources?Using AWS CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and AWS Config.

What is Amazon DynamoDB?A fully managed NoSQL database for high availability and performance.

What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk?A PaaS for deploying and managing applications without managing the infrastructure.

What is Amazon CloudFront?A Content Delivery Network (CDN) for delivering content with low latency.

Explain Amazon SNS.Simple Notification Service (SNS) enables messaging between distributed applications.

What is the difference between RDS and DynamoDB?

RDS: SQL-based, structured data.

DynamoDB: NoSQL, high scalability.

What are EIPs (Elastic IPs)?Static public IPs that can be assigned to EC2 instances.

How does AWS CloudTrail work?CloudTrail logs and monitors AWS API calls for security and compliance.

What is Amazon CloudWatch?A monitoring service for AWS resources and applications.

What is the AWS Free Tier?A limited free usage tier for new AWS customers.

What is a NAT Gateway?A NAT Gateway allows instances in a private subnet to access the internet securely.

Explain the Shared Responsibility Model in AWS.AWS manages infrastructure security, while customers secure their applications and data.

What are AWS Tags and why are they used?Tags are metadata labels for organizing AWS resources.

How do you troubleshoot VPC issues?Using VPC Flow Logs, route tables, and security group analysis.

What is the difference between NACL and Security Groups?

NACL: Stateless, applies to subnets.

Security Group: Stateful, applies to instances.

How do you communicate between multiple VPCs?

VPC Peering (direct connection)

Transit Gateway (scalable interconnection)

What is a VPC Endpoint?A private connection to AWS services without internet exposure.

What is Transit Gateway?A scalable hub for connecting multiple VPCs and on-premises networks.

How do you attach EC2 to an S3 bucket and what policies are used?

Use IAM roles with AmazonS3FullAccess or custom policies.

What is a Trusted Role in IAM?An IAM role that allows an AWS service or another account to access resources.

What is the difference between IAM Users and IAM Roles?

IAM User: Assigned to individuals with specific credentials.

IAM Role: Assigned to AWS services or federated users.

How do you secure data at rest and in transit in AWS?

At Rest: Use encryption (S3, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB).

In Transit: Use TLS/SSL.

Explain the difference between AWS S3 Standard and S3 Glacier.

S3 Standard: Low-latency, frequently accessed data.

S3 Glacier: Archival storage, low cost, retrieval delays.

How does AWS S3 versioning work?Maintains multiple versions of objects to prevent accidental deletions.

What is AWS ElastiCache?A managed caching service supporting Redis and Memcached.

Explain the concept of a Bastion Host.A jump server providing secure access to private instances.

How do you implement high availability in AWS?Using multiple Availability Zones, Load Balancers, and Auto Scaling.

What is AWS Direct Connect?A dedicated network connection between on-premises and AWS.
