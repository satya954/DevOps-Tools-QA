**Q1**. **How do you manage access control across multiple Azure subscriptions?**
  - In Azure, you can manage access control across multiple subscriptions by using **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**. By implementing **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, you can assign roles to users, groups, or applications at the subscription, resource group, or resource level.
  - Additionally, Azure AD **management groups** can be used to organize subscriptions and apply policies and RBAC permissions across multiple subscriptions.

**Q2**. **What is Azure Active Directory (AAD) and how does it work?**
  - **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** is a cloud-based identity and access management service. It helps manage users, groups, and permissions for Azure resources and applications.
  - AAD provides features such as **single sign-on (SSO)**, **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, and conditional access policies.
  - AAD can be integrated with on-premises Active Directory for hybrid identity management.

**Q3**. **What are Azure Resource Groups and how are they used?**
  - **Azure Resource Groups** are containers that hold related Azure resources such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and databases. They provide a way to organize and manage resources based on common characteristics such as lifecycle or application requirements.
  - Resource groups allow you to apply policies, monitoring, and access control at the group level, simplifying management.

**Q4**. **What is Azure Key Vault and how is it used?**
  - **Azure Key Vault** is a service for securely storing and managing secrets, keys, and certificates. It helps you safeguard sensitive information such as database connection strings, API keys, and SSH keys.
  - Key Vault integrates with Azure services and applications to securely access secrets and keys while ensuring they remain protected.

**Q5**. **How does Azure Load Balancer work?**
  - **Azure Load Balancer** is a fully managed service that distributes inbound traffic across multiple virtual machines (VMs) or services to ensure high availability and reliability.
  - It supports both **Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)** and **Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)** load balancing.
  - Azure Load Balancer is used in scenarios such as internal and external load balancing and can be configured to support auto-scaling applications.

**Q6**. **What is Azure Virtual Network and how does it work?**
  - **Azure Virtual Network (VNet)** is a private network within the Azure cloud that allows communication between Azure resources such as VMs, databases, and storage accounts.
  - VNets enable features like **subnets**, **VPNs**, **ExpressRoute**, and **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** to secure and segment network traffic.
  - VNets are essential for building secure, isolated environments in Azure.

**Q7**. **What is Azure DevOps and how is it used?**
  - **Azure DevOps** is a suite of development tools provided by Microsoft for building, testing, and deploying applications in Azure. It includes tools for **source control (Azure Repos)**, **continuous integration and continuous deployment (Azure Pipelines)**, **artifact management (Azure Artifacts)**, and **project management (Azure Boards)**.
  - Azure DevOps provides end-to-end DevOps lifecycle support and integrates with other Azure services like **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**, **Azure Functions**, and **Azure Virtual Machines**.

**Q8**. **What is Azure Monitor and how is it used for monitoring resources?**
  - **Azure Monitor** is a comprehensive monitoring service that provides visibility into the performance and health of Azure resources. It collects and analyzes telemetry data from your applications and infrastructure, such as logs, metrics, and events.
  - Azure Monitor integrates with other Azure services to enable proactive monitoring, alerting, and diagnostics for better performance management.
